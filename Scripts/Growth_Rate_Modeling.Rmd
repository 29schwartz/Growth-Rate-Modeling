## Loading Data

### Read this carefully!

```{r}

#using the flopr package to wrangle TECAN Spark data. See flopr on github for more info!
#' @param data_csv needs to be the raw TECAN data in CSV form!
#' @param layout_csv needs to be filled in according to the example layout.
#'    you can add as many columns as you want BUT THE LAST COLUMN MUST BE named 'well' and have the position for each well such as 'A1'
#'    
#'    Added the appropriate columns to the metadata file and load them here! It must be a .csv file type!

#load install

plate1 <- drop_na(flopr::spark_parse(data_csv = "../Data/KEDC_KGM_11July25.csv",
                                     layout_csv = "../Data/KGM_Metadata_11July25.csv",
                                     timeseries = TRUE))

#Change time if necessary! I am changing from seconds to hours! 
plate1 %>%
  mutate(across(time, ~.x / 3600)) %>%
  modify_if(is.character, as.factor) %>% 
  #This is critical so that R treats the replicates as a grouping and not as a number! If you don't have any replicates you can delete this line!
  
  # Add in this code chunk if you are normalizing by FL!
  # mutate(FL_OD = FL / OD600 ) %>%
  modify_at(c("Replicate"), as.factor) -> readydata

#Below are some other functions you may want to use just use the %>% operator as shown above if you want to change more things!
  #mutate(across(Plasmid, str_replace, 'pLW003', 'ev')) %>%
  #mutate(across(Plasmid, str_replace, 'pLW002', '+SIR')) %>%
  #mutate(Variant = Plasmid)
  
```

```{r}
#This code chunk is for subtracting out the starting value for each well so that all growth curves start at 0.00

plate1 %>%
  group_by(row, column) %>% 
  arrange(time) %>%
  #The column here should be whatever column will be used for your growth curve fitting
  mutate(blanked_OD600 = OD600 - first(OD600)) -> readydata
```

### Quick visualization of data

```{r fig.width= 6, fig.height= 6}
readydata %>%
  #For better visualization you may want to filter out timepoints
  #filter(time <= 15) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = OD600, color = Media)) + 
  geom_point() +
  #This allows you to split a single plot with many lines into individual plots based on a feature 
  facet_wrap(~Plasmid)+
  Theme
```

## Nesting Data

```{r}
#' @concept This is creating a nested data frame. The main difference between a nested data frame and grouped data frame is that for a grouped data frame, each row is an observation. For a nested data frame each row is a group of observations!

#This will allow us to easily apply function/models across all the data available. 
#Using Tidymodels we can then easily organize the coefficients for our different models!

#the across function allows for selecting specific columns! You always want the default 'time' column but you may want multiple features to be nested if you are measuring multiple absorbances. You can add or remove columns in the contain function as a string!


 readydata %>%
  select(-c(well, row, column)) %>%
  group_by(across(-c(time, contains(c("OD", "GFP"))))) %>%
  nest() -> by_variant
  
```

```{r}
source("../Functions/Gompertz_nls.R")

#Therefore, You have to decide when to filter the data so that it looks like a logistic curve! Use your positive control in complete media (if using M9C and M9sa) as a reference

by_variant %>%
  #Can't have NAs in any of the columns!
  nplyr::nest_drop_na(data) %>%
  #You will have to adjust these parameters a bit to get fits, especially if you cells grew poorly! These are good starting estimates. 
  mutate(model = pmap(list(data, A_par = 1.00, mu_par = .3, lambda_par = 3), gompertz.fit)) %>%
  #Create summary of coefficients
  mutate(summary = map(model, tidy)) %>%
  #Get residuals for model that can be plotted on top in a ggplot object
  mutate(augment = map(model, augment)) %>%
  #Using Glance to get an idea of model fit 
  mutate(model.fit = map(model, glance)) -> growth_variants
```

```{r, fig.height= 10, fig.width= 10}

#Use this graph to look at the fits quickly to see if they look ok!

growth_variants %>%
  unnest(augment) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = OD600)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, color = Replicate), linewidth = 1) +
  labs(y = 'Absorbance ('~OD[600]~')', x = "Timepoint (Hr)", title = "Growth Variants") +
  #scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0, 12)) + 
  #scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 1.8)) +
  facet_wrap(Media ~ Plasmid) +
  Theme
```

```{r}
#this code chunk will create a new column that lists the predictions for the estimates as well as their standard deviations and P-values. It will make an estimate_mu column which is the most important feature we care about!

growth_variants %>%
  unnest(summary) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = term, values_from = c(estimate, std.error, statistic,p.value)) -> fitted_variants

```

#Plotting Fitted Estimates

```{r, warnings = FALSE}
#This function will plot the estimate mu as a boxplot (you may want to use a scatter plot depending on the number of replicates)
fitted_variants %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Plasmid, y = estimate_mu, fill = RBS)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~Media) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
#This code chunk will calculate the change in growth rate of the cells in incomplete media relative to the complete media. 
fitted_variants %>%
  group_by(Plasmid, Replicate) %>%
  mutate(lesser_val = lead(estimate_mu)) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(percent_change = lesser_val / estimate_mu) -> mu_percent
```

```{r mu percent plot}
mu_percent %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Plasmid, y = percent_change)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = RBS )) +
  facet_wrap(~Promoter, scales = "free_x") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "M9sa Growth Rate Relative to M9C") + 
  theme_bw() +
